- Hay que usar LD_PRELOAD con v4lconvert.so o v4l2convert.so


Get software to use your webcam

Version 2.6.27 of the Linux kernel supports many new webcam drivers. Legacy Video4Linux API has been dropped, and these drivers now only support Video4Linux version 2. Pixel format decoding has been pushed to user space, since Video4Linux version 2 does not support kernel space decoding. The libv4l library provides userland applications with pixel decoding services and will be used by most programs. Other compatibility layers are also available.
If your device is created but your image looks strange (mine was nearly completely green), you probably need this.
If the application has V4L2 support but no pixelformat support (eg: cheese) then use the following command:
LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libv4l/v4l2convert.so cheese
If the application only supports the older version of V4L (Skype is the most popular of this kind of software) then use this command:
LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libv4l/v4l1compat.so skype
Tip: You also might want to put a line like the following into /etc/profile or xprofile so you do not have to type that long command all the time:
export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/'$LIB'/libv4l/v4l2convert.so
or
export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/'$LIB'/libv4l/v4l1compat.so
